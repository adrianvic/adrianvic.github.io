    To My dreams
    S3RL and Sara

Take me to my dreams (my dreams)
Show me what this life

I taste the rainbow in the sky
I see the sounds as they pass me by
I'm falling through time as it flies away

Take me to my dreams (my dreams)
Show me what this lifetime means
I see inside and open my mind
Take me to my dreams, show me what's real
Show me what's real
Show me what's real
Show me what's real

Take me to my dreams (my dreams)
Show me what this lifetime means
I see inside and open my mind
Take me to my dreams

I hold emotions in my hand
And hear the echoes of future's past
I feel like I can understand it all
